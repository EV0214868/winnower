#TOROS Winnower web page

This django web app is designed to "winnow the wheat from the chaff" in the Image Difference analysis of astronomical images. 

Image Differencing will leave behind many fake objects due to bad subtraction that will be classified as bogus by a Machine Learning algorithm. This ML algorithm has to be 'trained' with labeled data and this website provides a web interface to generate this training set via human input classification.
